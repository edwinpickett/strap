                The issue of inspiration, dear reader is a double-edged sword, where some artists are driven mad by the abundance of this inner fire, others often lament it’s absence. If you are of the latter group rejoice for I have solutions to your troubles. I will tell you how to light the fire and keep it ablaze.
                </p>
                <p>
                Inspiration is the necessary fire to the forge of art, it is essential in the act of creation. Remember this well, uninspired achievements can never be art, for if the artist himself is uninspired then his creations will fail to inspire anyone. 
                Most artists understand this and refrain from attempting to produce without inspiration. This cautious approach is commendable since it spares us the heaps of garbage produced by uninspired artists. 
                However traps lie within this approach. An artist might think that inspiration will simply find him by chance and therefore he is to be idle and patient. Quickly does this patience and idleness turn into indolence and sloth.
                You can’t fall for this trap reader, instead you must seek - seek for the secret fire and you shall find it.

                <h3 class="text-center">Finding The Spark</h3>
                <em><p class="text-center">~If you seek the fire - seek where it’s remnants can still be found~</p></em>
                <p>f you seek the fire - seek where it’s remnants can still be found - in the artistry it has already forged. You will find inspiration in the creations of others, read stories, look at paintings, sculptures, architecture, Seek out masterful craftsmanship and it’s fire shall pass unto you. Whether you read fiction, scroll through <u><a href="www.artstation.com"> Artstation</a></u> play a video game or watch a movie chances are they will make you feel something. This feeling will be your spark. If you are uncertain as to what to do with this spark fear not, for this too shall be revealed. 
                Be warned however you must be wary as not to commit the sin of theft. You run the risk of making something marvellous only to one day find out that you have stolen another artist’s work. The solution to this issue is very simple. Refrain from looking for sparks within the works of the same type as your own creations. If you are a minstrel-seek not in music. If you are a painter-seek not in paintings.

                <h3 class="text-center">Creation Itself</h3>
                <em><p class="text-center">~Nature is the art of God~<br>Dante Alighieri</p></em>
                <p>
                All art is ultimately inspired by the world we inhabit. Whether directly or by proxy we reflect the mysterious being through the lens of humanity and individual psyche. Chances are you’ve limited yourself in your everyday life to only a fraction of existence. You have grown so accustomed to it, rarely does it inspire you. To draw the spark from Creation itself you must seek within it.  Travel near and far, from losing yourself by roaming aimlessly through your own town to traversing swamps and forests on the other side of the globe. There and in-between is where you will find the fire. Not knowing where you are headed, being lost, the sense of adventure, shrouded in the majesty of nature is where you will collect your sparks. Whether your journey is filled with comfort or dread, you will find material ready to be channeled into your work.
                This concept of travel feeds into the idea that music is motion thus motion will inspire music, this to me is a tenant I hold with conviction.
                Although this method seems to require greater effort, it is far more beneficial in the long run. You will spend most of your time indoors, studying your craft and perfecting it, seeking inspiration outside will be a healthy change for your body.

                 <h3 class="text-center">Stress is Fuel</h3>
                <em><p class="text-center">~It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.~<br>Chuck Palahniuk</p></em>
                <p>
                Stress is a trigger for inspiration. Put yourself through controlled physical hardship and inspiration will follow. Your art is a release but mental stress is unpredictable and tricky whilst controlled physical stress is always beneficial.
                Have a go at <u><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/">cold showers</a></u>, try running until exhaustion kicks in, challenge a friend to a fistfight or a race. Keeping your body on edge will ensure an inspirational atmosphere. Push yourself until you taste the adrenaline in your mouth. When your body is exhausted your mind will speak the language of fire.

                <p>Now that you’ve found a spark you’ll have to turn it into something. The creation of art can be a complicated process and it may require a considerable amount of time to complete. During this time you run the risk of your fire dying out, and your work being thrown unto the pile of never-to-be finished projects. The spark you have found has to be defined in your mind. It’s meaning and feel have to make sense to you. You have to mold these ideas into a coherent shape from which you will forge your masterpiece.
                To do this, you must come up with a clear image in your head of what it is you are trying to convey. Secondly you must find related imagery which fits your idea. Browsing Artstation has always worked for me in this particular case.</p>
                <p>I’d gather visual guides anywhere between four and fifteen images which would keep me in check. When I make music, every time I’m reviewing my progress I watch this visual reference to be sure I haven’t strayed from my vision. You should also build a list of words or expressions that are correlated to the essence of what you are trying to portray.</p>
                <p>
                Use these tools to help yourself flesh out your imagination. You will need focus and determination, as it is likely that after an extensive amount of time spent on a project, it will appear to be ugly to you. It is at this point that you must persevere. 
                Even if you are unsatisfied with the finished result, you will come out of the ordeal with valuable experience.</p>
